# Image segmentation

The purpose of this project is to provide an introduction to image segmentation. You'll find:
1. A notebook that provides an introduction to image segmentation using the  [DeepLabV3](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/deeplabv3.html) model and the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) : [intro_to_img_seg.ipynb](./intro_to_img_seg.ipynb).
2. A notebook with a real time image segmentation and quantization implemented using a pretrained [YOLOv11 model](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/#overview) from [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) : [realtime_segmentation.ipynb](./realtime_segmentation.ipynb).
3. A Flutter mobile application which uses a YOLOv11 model for real time image segmentation: [image_segmentation_app](./image_segmentation_app/).
